            Richard and Chanmi first met when they served in a worship band together for a youth event. <br>
            
            Richard was interested and tried to get to know Chanmi better. <br>
            
            Chanmi, on the other hand, thought they could end up being good friends. <br>
            
            After six months of pursuit and lots of praying on both ends, Chanmi finally realized that Richard was someone she was meant to be with. <br>
            
            Chanmi decided to give Richard a chance. <br>
            
            On Janaury 28th, 2018, Richard popped the question and asked Chanmi to marry him. <br>
            
            She said YES! <br>
            
            We are so excited to see what God will do in the next chapter of our lives together, and we look forward to celebrating our special day with you! <br>
